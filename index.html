    <body> <h1 id="caca"> My favorite hobby is playing games </h1>
      <p id="idek"> I like to play simple fun games, that help me get a brainbreak. Sometimes i play with friends and sometimes i play alone.<br> A game is to play video or computer games,a form of play or sport, especially a competitive one played according to rules and decided by skill, strength, or luck. or manipulate (a situation), typically in a way that is unfair or unscrupulous.</p>
